description: This dataset includes the electrophysiological and behavioral data 
  from hippocampal CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex in mice performing a virtual
  reality spatial navigation task. Data are described in Prince et al., 2025, 
  “New information triggers prospective codes to adapt for flexible navigation”,
  Nature Communications. Head-fixed mice were trained to perform a memory-based 
  decision-making task in virtual reality (the 'update task'). In this y-maze 
  task, animals were required to navigate between two possible paths using 
  visual cues. On most trials, the first original cue indicated the final reward
  location and was followed by a delay period during which mice had to maintain 
  the memory of the correct goal arm. However on a subset of trials, a second 
  visual cue appeared when mice reached a specific location after a shortened 
  delay period. During the second cue, the visual patterns appeared on the 
  opposite wall from the original cue indicating that the reward location 
  switched from the initial arm, and animals must switch from their initial 
  decision maintained in memory to the opposite choice. After several phases of 
  behavioral training, electrophysiological data was recorded from hippocampal 
  CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during the task.
