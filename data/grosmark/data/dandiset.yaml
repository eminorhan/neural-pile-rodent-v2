description: This data set is composed of eight bilateral silicon-probe 
  multi-cellular electrophysiological recordings performed on four male 
  Long-Evans rats in the Buzsáki lab at NYU. These recordings were performed to 
  assess the effect of novel spatial learning on hippocampal CA1 neural firing 
  and LFP patterns in naïve animals. Each session consisted of a long (~4 hour) 
  PRE rest/sleep epoch home-cage recordings performed in a familiar room, 
  followed by a Novel MAZE running epoch (~45 minutes) in which the animals were
  transferred to a novel room, and water-rewarded to run on a novel maze. These 
  mazes were either A) a wooden 1.6m linear platform, B) a wooden 1m diameter 
  circular platform or C) a 2m metal linear platform. Animals were rewarded 
  either at both ends of the linear platform, or at a predetermined location on 
  the circular platform. The animal was gently encouraged to run 
  unidirectionally on the circular platform. After the MAZE epochs the animals 
  were transferred back to their home-cage in the familiar room where a long (~4
  hour) POST rest/sleep was recorded. All eight sessions were concatenated from 
  the PRE, MAZE, and POST recording epochs. In addition to hippocampal 
  electrophysiological recordings, neck EMG and head-mounted accelerometer 
  signals were recorded, and the animal’s position during MAZE running epochs 
  was tracked via head-mounted LEDs.
