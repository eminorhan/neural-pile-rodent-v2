description: "Extensive research shows that visual cortical neurons respond to specific
  stimuli, e.g. the primary visual cortical neurons respond to bars of light with
  specific orientation. In contrast, the hippocampal neurons are thought to encode
  not specific stimuli but instead represent abstract concepts such as space, time
  and events. How is this abstraction computed in the mouse brain? Specifically, how
  does the representation of simple visual stimuli evolve from the thalamus, which
  is a synapse away from the retina, through primary visual cortex, higher order visual
  areas and all the way to hippocampus, that is farthest removed from the retina?\n\nThe
  current OpenScope project aims to understand how the neural representations of simple
  and natural stimuli evolve from the LGN through V1, and most hippocampal regions,
  as well as some of the frontal areas. \n\nStimuli presented\nTwo main categories
  of visual stimuli were presented–\n1.\tSimple visual motion, elicited by basic stimuli,
  like bars of light.\n2.\tComplex, potentially ethologically valid visual stimuli,
  elicited by movies involving eagles (and squirrels).\nTo parametrize the stimulus
  properties which might be affecting neural responses, mice were shown variants of
  the vertical bar of light as follows:\nA(o) – The bar of light was white, moving
  on a black background, 15 degrees wide, and moved at a fixed speed, covered the
  entire width of the screen in 2 seconds. It covered both movement directions consecutively
  (naso-temporal, then temporo-nasal).\nA(i) – Similar to A(o), but the bar was now
  thrice as wide (45o)\nA(ii) – Similar to A(o), but the bar was thrice as slow (covering
  the width of the screen in 6 seconds).\nA(iii) – Similar to A(o), but the contrast
  was flipped, i.e. a black bar of light on a white background.\nA(iv) - Similar to
  A(o), but instead of a simple white bar, the stimulus was striped, and each stripe
  changed color as the stimulus moved through the width of the screen. This was called
  “disco” bar of light\nA(v) – In a subset of mice, A(o) was appended by frames corresponding
  to the bar of light “vanishing” at either of the edges. Two vanishing protocols
  were attempted, the bar of light is fully absorbed by the boundary, before reemerging.
  Another protocol had the bar of light vanish for ~1 second in addition to smoothly
  being absorbed by the boundary, before reemerging."
