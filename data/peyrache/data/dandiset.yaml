description: The head-direction (HD) system functions as a compass, with member 
  neurons robustly increasing their firing rates when the animal's head points 
  in a specific direction. HD neurons may be driven by peripheral sensors or, as
  computational models postulate, internally generated (attractor) mechanisms. 
  We addressed the contributions of stimulus-driven and internally generated 
  activity by recording ensembles of HD neurons in the antero-dorsal thalamic 
  nucleus and the post-subiculum of mice by comparing their activity in various 
  brain states. The temporal correlation structure of HD neurons was preserved 
  during sleep, characterized by a 60°-wide correlated neuronal firing (activity
  packet), both within and across these two brain structures. During rapid eye 
  movement sleep, the spontaneous drift of the activity packet was similar to 
  that observed during waking and accelerated tenfold during slow-wave sleep. 
  These findings demonstrate that peripheral inputs impinge on an internally 
  organized network, which provides amplification and enhanced precision of the 
  HD signal.
